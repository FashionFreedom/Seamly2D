This file contains explanation how to publish
a package onto LaunchPad.
Some string useful for local testing creation recipe.
Here used technique when you have separate debian directory 
and merge it with source using recipe file.


# This is standard command to work on DEB packaging:
#
# To install all packagers tools:
# sudo apt-get install bzr-builder bzr dpatch pbuilder debootstrap devscripts debhelper build-essential

# Init local working env
- Create account on launchpad.org
- Create Project
- Import branch from git mirror
- Create new recipe
- Upload SSH public key onto account
- Upload you GPG sign key
- Run from command line: 
    bzr launchpad-login yourlogin
    bzr whoami "Your Name <email@email.com>"
- Create a file /.pbuilderrc with content (need for local testing creation recipe)
	## Overrides /etc/pbuilderrc

	# Default distribution
    # Uncomment if you want different distribution system than you use now.
	#DISTRIBUTION=saucy
	COMPONENTS="main restricted universe multiverse"

	# Repositories
	MIRRORSITE=http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
	OTHERMIRROR="deb ${MIRRORSITE} ${DISTRIBUTION} ${COMPONENTS} | deb ${MIRRORSITE} ${DISTRIBUTION}-backports ${COMPONENTS} | deb ${MIRRORSITE} ${DISTRIBUTION}-security ${COMPONENTS} | deb ${MIRRORSITE} ${DISTRIBUTION}-updates ${COMPONENTS} | deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-sdk-team/ppa/ubuntu ${DISTRIBUTION} main"
	# Last PPA is example how to add additional PPA to your local build system. Useful when you want use packages that don't exist in standard repository.

	# For build results (in this directory you will find deb packages. Don't forget this path!)
	BUILDRESULT=${HOME}/pbuilder/result

	# Mount directories inside chroot environment
	BINDMOUNTS=${BUILDRESULT}
- Make our pbuilder trust packages from our PPA
For example you added PPA ubuntu-sdk-team, now you need add public key for using this PPA.
First, we'll login to our pbuilder environment:
	sudo pbuilder --login --save-after-login
Then, we'll give it the public key to our PPA, just like if we were adding it to our own keyring:
	apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys [YOUR PUBLIC KEY HERE]
If all goes well, you can leave your pbuilder environment by typing:
	exit
- Tell the pbuilder environment that it is going to act just like the Launchpad build farm
Still in our terminal:
    sudo pbuilder create --debootstrapopts --variant=build
-  Update our environment with these new packages
Still in our terminal, type:
	sudo pbuilder --update --override-config
- Edit file ~/.bashrc ti add
DEBFULLNAME="<Your name>" 
DEBEMAIL="<Your email address>" 

# Init package tools for launchpad
- Create a Bazaar directory
    mkdir bzr
- Create debian directory and upload it onto bzr branch ~dismine/seamly2d/debian
    cd bzr
    mkdir debian
    cd debian
    bzr init
    cp -pr seamly2d/debian bzr/debian
    bzr add debian
    bzr commit -m "Init"
    bzr push lp:~dismine/seamly2d/debian
  or download it from launchpad bazaar:
    cd bzr
    bzr branch lp:~dismine/seamly2d/debian
- To update this debian directory, edit files into the bzr dir and run
    bzr commit -m "Description of change"
    bzr push lp:~dismine/seamly2d/debian
- Create a file seamly2d.recipe with content
    cd bzr
    vi seamly2d.recipe
        # bzr-builder format 0.3 deb-version {debupstream}+{revno}+{revno:packaging}
        lp:seamly2d
        merge packaging lp:~dismine/seamly2d/debian

	Next command useful for local testing creation recipe.
- Run command
    cd bzr
    bzr dailydeb --allow-fallback-to-native seamly2d.recipe working-dir
  This will create a directory "working-dir" with seamly2d sources and will add sources from ~dismine/seamly2d/debian
- Test package sources
    sudo pbuilder build <working-dir>/<project>_<version>.dsc
    Example: sudo pbuilder build working-dir/seamly2d_0.2.2.dsc
