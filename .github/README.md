Seamly2D is pattern design software to create reusable, scalable, sharable custom-fit patterns using bespoke tailoring, haute couture, and historical pattern drafting techniques. Seamly2D saves time and improves fit by creating patterns that are reusable parametric CAD engineering documents.

Unlike other pattern design software, Seamly2D allows designers to have complete control of the patternmaking process. Each reusable, scalable pattern can read multi-size tables for boutique sizing, *and* read individual measurement files for custom-fit.

Seamly2D is open source software released under the GPLv3+ license.  Seamly2D is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.  Learn more about Seamly2D by joining our active, friendly community at https://forum.seamly.net

## Build Seamly2D

Basic Software Prerequisites:  
* Qt 5.15.0 or later - https://www.qt.io/download-open-source (includes Qt, QtCreator, QtChooser, and Qt Maintenance Tool)
* Git - either Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads or Github Desktop (recommended for Windows and Mac) from https://desktop.github.com/
* Compiler - MSVC 2019, gcc, and g++ are included with QtCreator, and you can add or update them using the Qt Maintenance Tool.
* XpdfWidget/Qt - https://www.xpdfreader.com/XpdfWidget.html
* Check the sections below for your operating system to find additional installation requirements

Development methods and styles:
   * Git Flow workflow: https://medium.com/@devmrin/learn-complete-gitflow-workflow-basics-how-to-from-start-to-finish-8756ad5b7394
   * Gibhub commit message style guide: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
   * Github issue description style guide: https://guides.github.com/features/issues/

Build method:
   * Building with Qt: https://forum.seamly.net/t/how-to-build-with-qt/1833

## Install Additional Libraries and Programs:

### to build Seamly code on Linux (general)
* Install QtCreator for your distribution: https://wiki.qt.io/VendorPackages.
* For Linux in general, these additional tools and libraries may be required:
- g++ compiler (at least GCC 4.7 is needed and GCC 4.8 is recommended) OR clang (minimum clang 3.4 (2014), current 5.0 (2017)),
- poppler (pdftops)
- OpenGL libraries
- XMLpatterns qt5 xml bindings https://command-not-found.com/xmlpatterns
* All Qt-tools come as qmake-qt5, etc. If you build from command line instead of within Qt Creator, run the following prior to running *qmake-qt5*:
```
    export QT_SELECT=5
```
* The default prefix for command `make install` is `/usr`. For using another prefix build with qmake command:  
```
    qmake PREFIX=/usr/local PREFIX_LIB=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu Seamly2D.pro -r CONFIG+=noDebugSymbols CONFIG+=no_ccache
```
where `/usr/local` is a new prefix for installation binary files and `/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu` is new prefix for install libraries.
Add path to Qt using `.bashrc`

#### Fedora
```
sudo yum groupinstall "C Development Tools and Libraries"  
sudo yum install mesa-libGL-devel  
```
#### Suse
```   
sudo zypper install -t pattern devel_basis  
```
#### Ubuntu
* If Qt is not completely installed on your distrubution, follow instructions here https://wiki.qt.io/Install_Qt_5_on_Ubuntu#Install_Qt_5_on_Ubuntu
* Install the following additional packages:
```
  sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test     
  sudo apt-get -qq update  
  sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-7 60 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-7  
  sudo apt-get install -y build-essential mesa-utils mesa-common-dev libgl1-mesa-dev  
  sudo apt-get install -y poppler-utils  
  sudo apt-get install -y xvfb  
  sudo apt-get install -y libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype6-dev  
  sudo apt-get install -y libx11-devlibxext-dev libxfixes-dev libxi-dev  
  sudo apt-get install -y libxrender-dev libxcb1-dev libx11-xcb-dev libxcb-glx0-dev
  sudo apt-get install -y libqt5xmlpatterns5-dev
```
* Manually retrieve and install `ccache`
```
wget https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/ccache_3.7.7-1_amd64.deb.html
sudo dpkg -i ccache_3.7.7-1_amd64.deb.html
```

### MAC OSX
* Download QtCreator - https://www.qt.io/download-thank-you
* Configure Qt & QtCreator - https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/macos.html
* Install clang compiler - _Would some of our Mac devs complete this section?
* Additional - _Would some of our Mac devs complete this section?_

### Windows 10
* Download QtCreator - https://www.qt.io/download-thank-you
* Configure Qt & QtCreator- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60245433/how-to-install-qt5-libraries-for-windows-10-for-cmake-development  
- Xpdf v4.0.0 (xpdftools) from http://www.xpdfreader.com/download.html. Put tool pdftops.exe in the same directory with Seamly2D's binary file.
* Add the Qt directory to the Windows PATH environment variable through Control Panel:
```
     [Control Panel|System And Security|System|Advanced Tab|Environment Variables button]
```
___________________________________________________
## Additional Information about Qt

* Add Seamly2d, gcc, g++, xpdf, and QtCreator directories (eg `c:\Qt\%VERSION%\bin`)to your operating system's `PATH` environment variable via Linux `.bashrc` or Windows' Control Panel.
* Use *QtChooser* to update and set the latest QT version as default.
* In *QtCreator* create your compiler kit (eg MSVC 2019, g++, gdb) and assign the compiler kit to your project. This automatically defines your Qt variables for compilers, debuggers, etc.
* Build Seamly2D from within *QtCreator* (see [forum post](https://forum.seamly.net/t/how-to-build-with-qt/183)) **OR** from command line using Qt's *qmake-qtx* from a terminal window:
```
cd $SOURCE_DIRECTORY\build
qmake ..\Seamly2D.pro -r CONFIG+=noDebugSymbols CONFIG+=no_ccache
make (or nmake or jom, depending on your platform)
```
