# Seamly2D

<big>Seamly2D</big> is pattern design software to create scalable, sharable custom-fit patterns using bespoke tailoring, haute couture, and historical pattern drafting techniques. Seamly2D saves time and improves fit by creating patterns as reusable, editable parametric CAD engineering documents.

Unlike other pattern design software, Seamly2D allows designers to have complete control of the patternmaking process. Each Seamly2D pattern can read multi-size tables for boutique sizing *and* read individual measurement files for custom-fit.

Seamly2D is open source software released under the GPLv3+ license.  Seamly2D is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.  

Learn more about Seamly2D by joining our friendly, active user [forum](https://forum.seamly.io) and reading our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). On our forum you may post questions about patternmaking and Seamly2D in any language you choose, as sewing terms are rich with idioms that are not always translatable word-for-word.
